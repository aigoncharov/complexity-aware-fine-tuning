# Code for "Complexity-aware fine-tuning" paper

General purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned to improve performance in niche domains. Although fine-tuning is a standard practice, we still lack a deep understanding of how to aggregate data for better results. In this work, we show that the entropy-based output estimation provides a meaningful guideline for fine-tuning data preparation. Specifically, across two small open models ~3B$ we find that a single token answer entropy shows ROC AUC score of ~0.73 and allows us to split the training data into three complexity categories. Moreover, we discover that these categories require different tuning mechanisms. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that outperforms the standard approach (TODO vs TODO accuracy). We also provide an in-depth analysis of alternative complexity estimation techniques based on expert assessment via model-as-judge (MASJ), entropy aggregation, and reasoning metadata with ROC AUC scores of 0.57, TODO and TODO accordingly. Our findings facilitate immediate enhancements in fine-tuning performance. In addition, we path the way to further investigation and immersion of the numerical complexity analysis.
